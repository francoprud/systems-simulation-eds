# Molecular Dynamics Simulation of Hard Spheres: Brownian motion

Practical Work for the System Simulation 2016 Course at ITBA.

The main objective is to simulate the motion of N colliding particles according to the laws of elastic collision using event-driven simulation.

Statement of the practical work can be found at doc/TP3_Enunciado.pdf.
